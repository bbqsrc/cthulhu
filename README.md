# Cthulhu

Generate FFI-compatible `extern fn` from harmless `fn`s using the power of proc
macros. If you are wondering which ABI this is, remember: You can't spell
Cthulhu without C!

## Usage

Invoke the hive mind of chaos by adding the `#[cthulhu]` to your function.

### "Supported" automatic conversion

- [x] `bool` to `c_char`
- [x] Boring number conversions as defined in [`std::os::raw`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.36.0/std/os/raw/index.html)
- [x] `Arc<str>` to `(*const char, usize)`
- [x] `&'a CStr` to `*const char`
- [x] `CString` to `*mut char`

## Why?

You might even say it's [cursed](https://github.com/bbqsrc/cursed).

## Is it any good?

Oh my sweet summer childâ€¦
